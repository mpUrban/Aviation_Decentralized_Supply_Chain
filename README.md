# Aviation Decentralized Supply Chain Application

These UML diagrams detail the architecture of an application to track used part status and sales for the aviation industry.  This is Part A of the Udacity project.   

***Class diagram:*** A structure that represents the components of a systems by illustrating the system's classes, attributes, operations, and how the objects may be connected.<br>
***Object diagram:*** A pictoral graph describing instances and their associated objects and data values.<br>
***State diagram:*** - Shows changes from one state to another and usually depicts the creation state and final states if there are any.<br>
***Activity diagram:*** - Flow of one activity to another in the system. Captures dynamic behavior of the system.<br>
***Sequence diagram:*** - Integration between objects in the sequence in which they take place.<br>
